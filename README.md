This project is all about detecting faces and objects.Here I have used Haarcascade data set and open CV to detect Faces and It's defferent facial expressions.
In one section I have also used tenserflow and keras API to actually create a neural network of 4 layr(1 input layr,1 Output Layr and 2 hidden layr) 
and then i trained it using MNIST data set of different fashion objects which have almost 60000 images and it's labels and 20000 training images and their 
labels.Labels are from 0 to 9.
